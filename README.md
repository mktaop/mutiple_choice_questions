**UPDATE (3/10/25):**  **Use** app_new_0325.py.  I adjusted the app so it is using Gemini 2.0 Flash, and touched up the code so that there are very few repeat question within one session.  And some other upgrades. 

This app retrieves a STEM related question from Google's Gemini model and asks the user to answer the question...The user is provided with 4 choices, the answer is graded as correct or incorrect.  In both cases, an explanation is provided.
The user can ask for another question, as many times as s/he wants.
The code should run as is...But, expects that you have a Google Gemini API key and the required libraries installed.
If it doesn't work, google the error to fix the code.
Please star this repo.
Enjoy.
